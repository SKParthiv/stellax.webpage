Thank you so much for considering contributing to this landing page. üôè

## Considerations before Contributing
Check if there is a GitHub issue already for the thing you would like to work on. If there is no issue yet, create a new one.

Let us know, in the issue, that you would like to work on it and how you plan to approach it.
This helps, especially with the more complex issues, as it allows us to discuss the solution upfront and make sure it is well planned and fits with the rest of the project.

## Repo organization

Repo has two important branches: [main](https://github.com/StellaX-Browser/stellax.webpage) branch and [dev](https://github.com/StellaX-Browser/stellax.webpage/tree/dev) branch.

`main branch` contains the actual codebase that is live and published.

`dev branch` is the development branch that all the contributors and developers who are working on the website codebase should worry about.
